## 🧠 Graphical Abstract

</p>

**Swin-SFF** is a novel swin transformer based framework for 3D shape estimation from focus image stacks. It leverages the hierarchical architecture of the Swin Transformer and integrates various focus measure strategies to enable accurate and robust focus level detection. The model performs sharpness evaluation directly in the deep feature space using multi-scale attention mechanisms, which enhance discriminative power in both low-texture and noisy regions. Extensive comparisons with classical and deep SFF techniques show that Swin-SFF consistently outperforms existing approaches in both quantitative and visual evaluations.

## 🔧 Installation

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv swin_sff
source swin_sff/bin/activate
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📥 Dataset Setup (COCO)

To train the model using unsupervised learning on the COCO dataset:

1. Download the COCO `train2017` dataset from the [COCO website](https://cocodataset.org/#download).
2. Place the images inside the following directory:

```
SwinSFF/coco/train2017/
```

---

## 🚀 Training

Run the training script as follows:

```bash
python train.py --epochs 25 --batch_size 2 --ssim_index 2
```

Model checkpoints and training losses will be saved in the `models/` directory.

---

## 📦 Training Outputs

Each `.pth` file saved in `models/` includes:
- `state_dict` of the trained model
- History of:
  - L1 (pixel) loss
  - SSIM loss
  - Total combined loss

---

## 🧪 Testing trained model

To test the model on a set of simulated focus images:

1. Put your test images into a folder, for example:

```
SwinSFF/outputs/<your_image_path>/
```

2. Run the test:

```bash
python test.py --imgs_folder outputs/<your_image_path> --model_path models/<your_trained_model_weights>.pth

```

3. The output images (with extended depth of field) will be saved to:

```
# The final fused image with extended depth of field (EDF)
outputs/<your_image_path>/output/fused.png

# Corresponding estimated depth map (saved as a text file)
outputs/<your_image_path>/output/fused.txt               

# Interactive 3D visualization of the fused image with depth map
outputs/<your_image_path>/output/fused3D.html 

# 3D visualization with mean-filtered depth map for smoother surface rendering
outputs/<your_image_path>/output/fused3D_filtered.html   

```
